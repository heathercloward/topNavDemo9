                                <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> DSP® 
 version 6.5 implements a new licensing scheme that ties the license key to a hardware ID specific to the application server on which DSP® is installed. 
 This license key will therefore not work on other machines. In addition, 
 hardware changes to the server, including virtual machine reconfiguration, 
 may cause the license to be invalidated. In the event of a hardware change, 
 server move, or other action that may require a new license to be issued, 
 please open a Support message via SAP Solution Manager using component XX-PART-BOA to request a new license. The request for a new license&#160;should be made a minimum of 2 business days before the license is needed to allow time for review and approval.</p>

                                <p>Transform provides measurable advantages in the Data Preparation phase of a data migration project. The tool cleans, manipulates and reports on data, and exports the data so that it can be loaded into a target ERP system using a load tool.</p>
                                <p>Use Transform to register target rules, target remediation rules, and target reports. Transform also creates Target Source rules and Target Source reports. A user can audit updates to target data as a result of rule processing, debug rules and reports, and view dashboards that display a count of active source rules, source reports, target rules and target reports by Wave and Process Area; the number of processes running for reports broken out by report type; and the count of changes to all object types in the Wave and Process Area.</p>
                                <p>Access to report data can be controlled at the report level by restricting access to reports, or through user filters assigned to a report.</p>

                                <h4>Profiling</h4>
                                <p>Profiling is a quick and easy method to perform an assessment of data contained within a database. The goal of data profiling is to save hours of research effort by listing all database information in one location. It is important to note that data profiling does not replace viewing and analyzing data, but is considered a value-added activity for reporting to the client and can provide useful information at the beginning of a Data Migration project.</p>
                                <p>The following elements are available for all profiled databases:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">A list of all tables in the database</li>
                                    <li value="2">A list of all columns within each table with defined Data Type, Length and Table Order</li>
                                    <li value="3">A frequency distribution of values for each column</li>
                                    <li value="4">A minimum and maximum value for each column</li>
                                    <li value="5">A number of blank, null or empty values for each column</li>
                                    <li value="6">Indication of unused tables and fields</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Duplicate Detection</h4>
                                <p>The duplicate detection feature provides an easy method to identify and resolve duplicate data. After the user creates and register the objects (tables and views) that contain the data to be analyzed for duplication, the process finds potential duplicate data and displays it on a results page. The user can configure this results page as needed. 
 The user reviews the results and identifies duplicate records to decide if the record is a true duplicate, if the record must be reset, or if the record is not a duplicate.</p>

                                    <li value="1">The LinkTag feature allows the page Designer to link to another page and pass an identifying string (stored in the Link Tag field) in order for that page to conditionally choose a Page Control View (PCV) by name. For example, webMyTable#LinkTag#Pcv can become webMyTable#LinkTag1#Pcv or webMyTable#LinkTag2#Pcv. An issue occurred when the wrong PCV was used and the identifying string (the value of the Link Tag) was not maintained throughout the usage of the page. 
 With this fix, the value of the LinkTag is always maintained and the correct PCV view is used. [DCR-595]</li>
