                                                <li value="1">Intermittently, 
 an error message displayed in the platform when the system was left idle due to an unhandled exception. With the fix, the exception is handled and logged in the Windows Event View with a status of Warning. The error message no longer displays.</li>
                                                <li value="2">In Collect, 
 when setting a filter on Collect’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Tables</span> 
 page, a user could not filter on the date and time when a refresh completed. 
 The Completed field accepted a filter value using the time but not the date. With the fix, the Completed field allows a user to enter a date to create the filter.</li>
                                                <li value="3">In Collect, 
 corrected an issue where the Duration field was sorting as text. With this fix the Duration field sorts numerically.</li>
                                                <li value="4">In Collect, 
 corrected an issue where a table refresh repeated indefinitely when the table name in Collect did not match the target table name in Assemble. 
 With this fix, an error message displays if the table name in Collect does not match the target table name in Assemble.</li>
                                                <li value="5">In Collect, 
 when building a Data Services RFC SAPAPPSERVER package, the record count was not updated correctly even though the package was successfully built. 
 With the fix, the record count is being updated.</li>
                                                <li value="6">In Common, 
 when a user clicked the Trace button for a data source, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Trace</span> 
 page did not display. The issue was caused by a large number of records that were retained in the debug log. A service page that runs once daily was created in Common to clear out the debug logs if the logs exceed 100K records. With the fix, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Trace</span> 
 page displays.</li>
                                                <li value="7">In Common, 
 a problem occurred during a System Type import. An import can add or delete records but must not update them. In this case, the key field indicator check box that had been unchecked was checked on import. Specifically if the key field on the System Type table was manually added and the key field did not exist in the source database, the system unchecked the key field indicator. With the fix, the key field is maintained as checked and is not updated during the import.</li>
                                                <li value="8" data-mc-conditions="Primary.dspMonitor">In dspMonitor, an issue occurred if a job was scheduled to run once daily. If the job ran over multiple minutes, a new job was created once a minute. &#160;The Next Run Date calculation was updated. 
 &#160;With the fix, multiple jobs are no longer created for jobs scheduled to run once daily.</li>
                                                <li value="9" data-mc-conditions="Primary.dspMonitor"><span>In dspMonitor, if a user created a report that uses an Order By clause, an error displayed when the user clicked the View icon on the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Reports</span><span> 
 page to view the report. SQL views were updated and a function was added. 
 With the fix, the report displays without the error.</span>
                                                </li>
                                                <li value="10" data-mc-conditions="Primary.dspMonitor"><span>The customer requested to run A Group in dspMonitor from Automate. A change was made to the event to allow this to happen.</span>
                                                </li>
                                                <li value="11">In Map, when refreshing Lookup tables that had been added or updated in Target Design, 
 the setting in the description fields on the Value Mapping Source Values did not always update the source value descriptions correctly. The source value description fields were blank. A Where clause was updated. With the fix, after a refresh, source value description fields display data correctly.</li>
                                                <li value="12">In Map, an issue occurred that allowed inactive mappings to display when a user clicked the Field Mappings icon for a lookup table on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value Mapping</span> page. If a lookup table was assigned to a target and synced with Map, and then the target’s design status was updated to Inactive in Target Design, the mappings for that table still displayed on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Field Mappings</span> page. With the fix, 
 only active target fields display.</li>
                                                <li value="13">In Map, The AutoMap icon on the Target Sources page in Map was disabled and Auto Mapping could not be performed under certain conditions. When a source (e.g., 
 a set of Excel files or a table with a custom table name such as KNA1_flatfile instead of ttKNA1) was added to an SAP target in Target Design, the icon was disabled if the user selected the source on the Target Sources page. 
 With the fix, Auto Mapping uses field names only and Auto Mapping is available for all sources.</li>
                                                <li value="14">In Map, a validation error displayed when a user attempted to update a field mapping that had already been mapped with a Copy action. After resetting the mapping, 
 if a user attempted to update the mapping to a NotUsed action, and any of the fields in the WHERE clause were empty, the error displayed. A validation view was written incorrectly. With the fix, a user can reset a mapping with a Copy action and update it to an action of NotUsed and the error does not display.</li>
                                                <li value="15">In Map, corrected an issue where Export Mapping caused a WebApp error. With this fix, Export Mapping is a background event and does not cause an error.</li>
                                                <li value="16">In Map, when refreshing Lookup tables that had been added or updated in Target Design, 
 the setting in the description fields on the Value Mapping Source Values did not always update the source value descriptions correctly. The source value description fields were blank. A Where clause was updated. With the fix, after a refresh, source value description fields display data correctly.</li>
                                                <li value="17">An issue occurred when SQL AutoGen generated source rules with a Copy action. The view and rule autogenerated for the source rules had an incorrect name that did not include a leading “z” for the field name. A SQL function was updated. With the fix, source rule and view names include zFieldName as expected.</li>
                                                <li value="18">An issue occurred when a field name (e.g., NAME2) 
 in the Target Design table matched a field name in the source and the target field was made inactive. The source field (e.g., NAME2) was set to inactive as well. The inactive status prevented the source field from being loaded into the Transform source table for data conversion. A source field may be used in other rules so the data is required. For example, 
 a business user may require that the values in the NAME2 source field be visible to use in a conversion rule, even though the target field with the same name is inactive. The fix allows source fields with the same name as inactive target field to load into the source table.</li>
                                                <li value="19">In Target Design, duplicate mapping records were created while importing the design of a target from a System Type. If the configuration in System Types did not match the Target Design configuration, then a duplicate entry was created. A new view was created that prevents the record duplication.</li>
                                                <li value="20">In Target Design, an issue occurred after reports were created in AutoGen. If any values were changed on the Target Lookup Table page in Target Design and the reports were rebuilt, the Lookup Table changes weren’t reflected in the reports. A target table join was not being updated. With the fix, 
 the join is updated when reports are rebuilt, and changes to Lookup tables display on reports.</li>
                                                <li value="21">In AutoGen, there was a problem generating a target table based on a Target Design that had many key fields, and the target was not created. With this correction, target tables based on Target Design with many key fields are generated as expected.</li>
                                                <li value="22">In Transform, an issue occurred when a secondary source with the same source ID as the primary source was added to a target. 
 Duplicate job IDs displayed on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Monitor</span> 
 page. The source ID column did not use the correct column in the view. 
 With the fix, the source ID column uses the primary key column in the view, and no duplicate records display on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Monitor</span> 
 page.</li>
                                                <li value="23">In Transform, when adding a target export, if a Migration Developer selected a load type of LSMW, BDC views displayed as an option in the Target Export list box on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target Exports</span> page. BDC views must not be used with exports of LSMW load type. A filter on the list box was updated, and BDC views no longer display in the list box when load type of LSMW is selected.</li>
                                                <li value="24">In Transform, a “MaxBufferSize Exceeded” error was returned when a report was executed. The DSPCommon ReportEngine's dll were patched by a 6.2.1.patch to resolve this error and applied to this version.</li>
                                                <li value="25">In Transform, reports that included a comma in a data field were not displaying in Excel correctly. This only occurred when the report was downloaded from My Reports in Transform. With this fix there is now a data field delimiter other than a comma (a value that is not likely to be in the data to be output). This will allow the Excel to display the data correctly.</li>
                                                <li value="26">In Transform, an issue occurred when a target export used a Database export type. The export could not be properly configured, 
 as a user could not select a database name for the export. The Export Instance field on the Vertical View of the Target Exports page was hidden. 
 With the fix, the field is visible and can be used to set up a Database export correctly.</li>
                                                <li value="27">In Transform, if a user saved a target export with an export type of Local File, an Assemble package was created and registered to the export. &#160;When the export package was changed in Assemble to use a different delimiter and in Transform the target export was modified/validated, 
 the incorrect delimiter (tabs) was written into in the package. With the fix, the Assemble delimiter is not overwritten by Transform and &#160;the export file is created with the desired delimiter.</li>
                                                <li value="28">In Transform, When processing an Export with "NONE" 
 for Target "Export Type", the action on was not updated.<br />When "Export Type" is "NONE", use "Export Name" 
 view to determine record count and update action on date.<br />With this fix , the record count and action on date are now correctly shown.</li>
                                                <li value="29">In Transform, an error occurred when a user entered a value in the Export Order By field on the Target Exports page’s Vertical View. After processing the export, when a user clicked the View Export icon on the Target Exports page, an error displayed. With the fix, an invalid ORDER BY clause was removed from the View Export query and the error no longer displays when a user clicks the View Export icon. The is Order By still applied to Target Export package if it is an Assemble package.</li>
                                                <li value="30">In Transform, when registering a Target Remediation rule on the Target Remediation page, rules for all targets were available for selection in the Target Report Remediation Rule View list box. A filter on the field was updated. With the fix, only rules for the selected target display.</li>
                                                <li value="31">In Transform, views were causing performance issues. 
 With this fix, several Transform views have been optimized to improve performance.</li>
                                                <li value="32">In System Administration, the Role Key Values page's performance has been drastically improved.
