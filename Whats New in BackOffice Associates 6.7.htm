When attempting to add lookup tables with a multipart key, the Multi Value Field Lookup Table Value Column field was required, but the values in that list box did not display until the record was initially saved. In other words, it was not possible to save the record because it was not possible to update the field on the <i>Horizontal</i> View. Instead, an error message displayed and the record that was being added no longer displayed. To correct the issue, the <i>Target Lookup Table</i> page switches to the <i>Vertical</i> View when the user clicks Save. The Multi Value Field Lookup Table Value Column field can then be updated from the <i>Vertical</i> View, and the record can be saved. [DSP-9509]</p>
