Formerly, while working in <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.dspConduct">dspMigrate™</MadCap:conditionalText>  in any component other than Console, if a user selected a Wave and Process Area in the Context Bar, Console would open and display data for the new context.  The user would then have to navigate back to the <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.dspConduct">dspMigrate™</MadCap:conditionalText>  component to continue working in it. For example, if a user was working in Map and selected a different context in the Context Bar, Console would open and the user would have to navigate back to Map. Now, when a user selects a Wave and Process Area in the Context Bar, Console does not open. The current page refreshes with data from the new context.</li>
