Add relationship joins between the Add Row and the Update Row source(s) where  the source information and source criterion comes from a table other than the Add Row table being mapped. The join indicates how the table in the Add Row source is joined to the table in the Update Row source so the update rules can be created and registered in Transform. For example, if the Add Row source table is Product (e.g., the LEFT TABLE is stMARC_AW_Product), and the Update Row source table is ProductInventory (e.g.,  the RIGHT TABLE is stAW_ProductInventory), a join would be set up on the keys between the two tables, the ProductID field.',l:''},'Remediation Report':{d:'Report generated after Transform has processed target data, and used as a basis to create remediation rules.

These include all primary key fields and all fields with an associated lookup table in Target Design. For example, if MATNR is a primary key on the material master target, the field zLegacyMATNR is automatically created on both the source and target tables and contains the legacy material number. In addition, if the field MEINS is assigned a lookup table of T006 in Target Design, the field zLegacyMEINS is also created on both the source table and target tables. It contains the legacy information required for cross referencing data via the lookup table.',l:''}});
