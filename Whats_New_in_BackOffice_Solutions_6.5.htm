                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Setting up a custom Security Role that only provides access to a single Wave-Process Area and limited objects did not prevent assigned users from seeing additional Process Areas and objects. Security checks were added to the Wave: Process Areas and &#160;Process Area: Object to prevent users from seeing Process Areas and objects they were not assigned to.</li>
                                    <li value="2">An error occurred when navigating to the Security Definitions page after a record was deleted from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Security Definition Keys</span> 
 page because the values for the key record were orphaned in the key value table. With the fix, the key definition and value records are deleted and the Security Definitions page loads correctly.</li>
                                    <li value="3">In System Administration, the tasks were not visible on the Failed Jobs page's <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View for the General job type. The Tasks option was added to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Failed Job</span>s page's <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View. 
 With this fix, the tasks are now visible.</li>
                                    <li value="4">Failures occurred at a client's site for reports due to incorrect syntax in the code when object names contain spaces or special characters. With this fix, the reports are generated with no failures. </li>
                                    <li value="5">Members of the Migration Developers group could not see the data source in Analyze after adding a data source in System Administration (on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Sources</span> 
 page). The DataSourceID was added to the Migration Developer Security Role which allows migration developers to see the data source when viewing the page.</li>
                                    <li value="6">The email address for license requests has been updated to licenserequests@boaweb.com. </li>
                                    <li value="7">When a validation failed for a soft required field, a warning message displayed. With the fix, validation failures for soft required fields return an error. </li>
                                    <li value="8">When a validation for a soft required field was created, it was saved with a nonstandard name and description that made identifying the validation difficult. With the fix, the name follows this naming convention: <br />[TableName] + [ColumnName] + NN + “Val” <br />The description that displays for a validation failure is clear: the target field names are translated, and instructions to remediate the issue are included. </li>
                                    <li value="9">When a validation for a list source was created, it was saved with a nonstandard name and description that made identifying the validation difficult. With the fix, 
 the name follows this naming convention:<br />web[PageTableName]_[ColumnName]_NotInListVal<br />The description that displays for a validation failure is clear: the target field names are translated, and instructions to remediate the issue are included. </li>
                                    <li value="10">When a validation failed for a list source, a warning message displayed. With the fix, validation failures for list sources return an error</li>

                                <h3>Target Design </h3>
                                <p>An issue occurred that prevented a user from adding a source when the number of roles and role key values is in the thousands. After a user clicked Add, the processing icon displayed followed by a network connection error. With the fix, an Insert statement in a stored procedure was optimized and a user can add sources without receiving the error. </p>
                                <h3>Transform</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Members of the ReportsOnly WebApp group in Transform could not access the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="All_Business_Reports_All_Wave_Process_Areas.htm">All Business Reports – All Wave/Process Areas</a></span> page. An update to the pages accessible to the WebApp group now allows members of that group to view the page.</li>
                                    <li value="2">A procedure in Transform had a poorly formed concatenated IN clause which caused performance issues on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Targets_H.htm">Targets</a></span> 
 and <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Target_Sources_H.htm">Target Sources</a></span> 
 pages. The procedure has been rewritten and views optimized to alleviate the performance issues. </li>
                                    <li value="3">When a new report header/footer created in Console was chosen in Transform, the header/footer did not display on the report. 
 With this fix, the new header/footer appears on the report. </li>
                                    <li value="4">An error occurred when a user entered a value in the Export Order By field on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Target_Exports_H.htm">Target Exports</a></span> page’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View. After processing the export, when a user clicked the View Export icon on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Target_Exports_H.htm">Target Exports</a></span> page, an error displayed. With the fix, an invalid ORDER BY clause was removed from the query used to view the target export from DSP®. The ORDER BY clause is placed in the Assemble package. The records in the export file sort by the ORDER BY and the error no longer displays when the user clicks the View Export icon. Note that when viewing the export from DSP®, the sort occurs by the left most column. </li>
                                    <li value="5">An error displayed if a user attempted to generate reports in Transform when the Report Generate Empty check box was disabled in Console on the Transform tab of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Parameters.htm">Parameters</a></span> 
 page. The Report Generate Empty setting determines whether Transform generates reports when there are no records on the report. With the fix, if the setting is disabled, only those reports that have records are generated from Transform.</li>
                                    <li value="6">When registering a Target Remediation rule on the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Target_Remediation_H.htm">Target Remediation</a></span> 
 page, rules for all targets were available for selection in the Target Report Remediation Rule View list box. With the fix, only rules for the selected target display. </li>
                                    <li value="7">Line feed characters from the field mapping fields in Map caused incorrect formatting in the Rulebook reports. With the fix, 
 the line feed characters have been removed and reports are formatted correctly.</li>
                                    <li value="8">If a target report had sampling configured, the sample report was not generated when the target was processed. With the fix, 
 a report with sampling configured generates the sampling report when the target is processed.</li>
                                    <li value="9">An error occurred when creating and executing a report that had an Order By clause. With the fix, reports can be created and executed in Transform with an Order By clause.</li>
                                    <li value="10">An issue occurred when a business user was assigned to a report segment, but not to the full report. When the report was executed, 
 the business user was removed from all of the report’s segments, so could not access any report data. With the fix, the business user remains assigned to the report segment and unassigned to the full report. The user can view report data for assigned segments only. </li>

                                    <li value="4">In online help, the naming convention for packages (#Database#%#Source#%) has been added. Refer to <a href="Create_Packages.htm">Create Packages</a> for more information.</li>

 the record changes could have been lost. With the fix, the system displays a warning that the record changes can be lost and the user is required to confirm the action.</li>
                                    <li value="6">In System Administration, added a parameter to adjust the number of days prior to expiration the license expiration warning message is displayed. </li>
                                    <li value="7">In Transform,
